# Tic tac toe recognition - image processing project

### General info
The application is designed to recognize the state of the game tic-tac-toe. It has been implemented in Python using the library OpenCV. 

In order to work in real time, using the appropriate application we send the image recorded with the phone's camera to the program. 

Automatic recognition of the game state occurs after pressing the Enter key for currently shared image. 

The algorithm's efficiency fluctuates around 95% for frames in basic conditions.
